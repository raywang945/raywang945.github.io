		<p>As a research assistant in Academia Sinica, I am involved in a program called <b>National Digital Archive Program</b>. The program promotes and coordinates content digitization and preservation at leading museums, archives, universities, research institutes and other content holders in Taiwan.</p>
		<p>The purpose of my research was to present an efficient and accurate error detecting system for speech recognition and optical character recognition. In order to compare speech or optical character recognition and the human recognizing result, I gathered human sources by corwdsourcing techniques.</p>
		<p>So far the collected data showed that the system provided for optical character recognition performed better than the traditional one. However, the system for speech recognition did not perform as well as expected, so I am still trying new solutions, and the research is still continuing.</p>

		<p>During my junior year in National Taiwan University, I engaged in a one-year project under Professor Tzi-Dar Chiueh's instruction. The project is focused on the implementation of beamforming, and I implemented this project with microphone arrays.</p>
		<p>The whole project included many procedural steps, from buying basic IC components like analog digital converters (ADC), digital analog converters (DAC) to welding circuits, and from deciding the space between each microphone with matlab simulation to controlling FPGA.</p>
